TODO:

    Turn all letters to lowercase

    Insert:
        Compare letter by letter while the two are the same
        If a difference is found:
            If letter from new word < letter from current word (a < b):
                Compare with word to the left start to end
            If letter from new word > letter from current word (c > b):
                Compare with word to the right start to end
        If there is an exact match:
            If current word is longer:
                Insert new word to the left
            If new word is longer:
                Insert new word to the right
            If both words have the same length:
                Update number of occurences
        
Test cases:
    Current word is longer
    New word is longer
