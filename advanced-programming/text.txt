Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions 
for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a
new article. On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been
protected to varying degrees. A frequently vandalized article can be "semi-protected" or "extended confirmed protected", meaning
that only "autoconfirmed" or "extended confirmed" editors are able to modify it.
